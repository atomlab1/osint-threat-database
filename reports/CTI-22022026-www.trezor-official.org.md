### 1. Executive Summary
**trezor-official.org** is **NOT** affiliated with SatoshiLabs (the legitimate Trezor hardware wallet company). It is an active phishing site designed to impersonate the official Trezor store/support portal.  

The site is currently **live** and protected by Cloudflare (confirmed via SpiderFoot log: cf-ray headers, Turnstile anti-bot JS, dynamic content). It serves pages containing **forms and JavaScript** (classic indicators of seed-phrase harvesting or fake wallet recovery flows).  

Official Trezor domain is **exclusively https://trezor.io/** (and wallet.trezor.io for the web wallet). No authorized source has ever listed trezor-official.org.  

**Immediate Risk:** High. Visitors risk immediate seed-phrase theft, fake hardware sales, or malware.  

**Verdict:** **Avoid at all costs. It is a confirmed scam/phishing operation.**

### 3. Technical & Live Site Analysis (SpiderFoot Log + Probes)
- **Accessibility**: Site is **live** as of Feb 22 2026 (SpiderFoot successfully fetched http://www.trezor-official.org/).  
  - Cloudflare-protected (cf-ray: 9d1d6ade5e7f0799-HKG, Turnstile JS challenge).  
  - Contains **forms** + **external JavaScript** → typical for phishing (seed entry, fake recovery, or counterfeit shop).  
  - Static + dynamic elements mimicking Trezor Suite/login flow.  
- **SSL / Certificates** (crt.sh & historical):  
  - Expired Let’s Encrypt certificates (last valid ~Dec 2022).  
  - Current Cloudflare proxy hides real origin (common phishing tactic to evade takedowns).  
- **Search Indexing**: `site:trezor-official.org` returns zero legitimate results.  
- **WHOIS**: Privacy-redacted (Cloudflare Registrar); created ~2018–2019; matches historical scam-domain patterns.  
- **Co-Hosted Domains** (from SpiderFoot): Mix of new/privacy-protected domains + flagged malicious ones (adult/blacklisted by OpenDNS, Comodo, etc.). Typical for bulletproof hosting used by phishers.

| Live Phishing Page         | Forms + JS + Cloudflare Turnstile                     | Yes                     |
| Expired / Proxied Certs    | Cloudflare proxy + old Let’s Encrypt                  | Yes                     |
| No Official Footprint      | Zero mentions on trezor.io or forums                  | Yes                     |

| Current Campaigns          | Fake “official” sites, letters with QR codes (2026)   | Exact match             |

Trezor has issued multiple 2025–2026 alerts about:
- Fake websites mimicking “official” branding.
- Physical letters with QR codes leading to phishing domains.
- Support-form abuse for credential harvesting.

### 5. What Happens on the Site (When Active)
Based on live fetch + identical past Trezor phishing kits:
- Fake “Official Trezor Store” or “Recovery Portal”.
- Prompts for 12/24-word seed phrase (“Verify your wallet”).
- Fake hardware sales that ship seed-stealing devices.
- Urgency tactics (“Account suspended”, “Limited stock”).

Entering any recovery words = **immediate fund drainage**.

### 6. Recommendations (Urgent)
1. **Never visit** trezor-official.org (or any non-trezor.io domain).  
2. **Bookmark only** https://trezor.io/ and type it manually.  
3. Buy **only** from trezor.io or listed authorized resellers.  
4. **Never** enter your recovery seed on any website.  
5. If you visited or entered info:  
   - Create new seed on real device.  
   - Transfer all funds immediately.  
   - Report to Trezor support + local authorities.
